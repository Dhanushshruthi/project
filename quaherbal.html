With historical roots in East Asia, people of different cultures from around the world have been drinking tea for thousands of years. Science appears to support this practice.

            But what is tea, exactly? In short, tea is the second most popular beverage in the world, next to water. Tea is produced by steeping the young leaves and leaf buds of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis into boiled water. Two types of tea are commonly used—the small-leaved China plant (C. sinensis variety sinensis) and the large-leaved Assam plant (C. sinensis variety assamica).
            
            A number of studies have shown that certain teas, such as green tea, can boost your immune system, fight off inflammation, promote cardiovascular health, and even prevent the development of certain cancers. These health benefits are associated with specific antioxidants found in tea, known as polyphenols.
